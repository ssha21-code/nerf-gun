# nerf-gun
This is a Raylib C++ game made from scratch.
It includes two characters, the Player, and the Enemy, who try to shoot each other with guns and try to win.
This game is my first game, with pictures.
The player can jump with key W, can move left with key A, can move right with key D, and can shoot with the space key.
The player has to transform to the gun shooting position with the E key.
The enemy shoots every 0.35 seconds and actively chases down the player.
The enemy wears a black shirt, while the player wears a red shirt.
The enemy and player have 200 HP.
The goal of the player is to shoot down the enemy and kill it, whilst using dodging tactics like moving and jumping.
